Here are the short paragraphs, slide by slide — already trimmed and ready for your deck. I’ve mixed in bullets where they help highlight key concepts.

Slide 1 (Title)

The SEO Gauntlet
A Tale of Two Workflows
How SEO has been done for 20 years, and what’s changing now.

⸻

Slide 2 (What SEO Is)

Search engines follow rules to decide which pages rank first. SEO is the work of adjusting your site so it shows up higher.

SEO breaks down into three jobs:
	•	Find what people search for
	•	Fix technical problems on the site
	•	Create and improve content

⸻

Slide 3 (The Old Way: Overview)

For the last two decades, SEO has been mostly manual:
	•	Many tools for each piece of the job
	•	Large data exports and spreadsheets
	•	Repeated cycles every time Google changed its rules

The result was slow, inconsistent, and expensive.

⸻

Slide 4 (Old Way: Keyword Research)

Finding keywords used to be a long process:
	•	Export data from Google Keyword Planner
	•	Compare with competitor tools
	•	Merge into one spreadsheet
	•	Manually group terms into topics

This often took days before any action could start.

⸻

Slide 5 (Old Way: Technical Audits)

Technical checks were fragmented and time-heavy:
	•	Crawl the site with Screaming Frog
	•	Check Google Search Console for errors
	•	Review page speed and mobile tests
	•	Copy issues into spreadsheets and prioritize manually

It required deep expertise and slowed teams down.

⸻

Slide 6 (Old Way: On-Page SEO)

Improving pages meant repetitive checks:
	•	Titles, headers, and keywords
	•	Internal links and alt text
	•	Repeat across dozens or hundreds of pages

Scaling this process was difficult and time-consuming.

⸻

Slide 7 (Old Way: Content Creation)

Content was another heavy lift:
	•	Analyze top search results
	•	Draft detailed briefs
	•	Research stats and sources
	•	Write, edit, and rewrite

Each article often took 8–12 hours to complete.

⸻

Slide 8 (Summary of Old SEO)

The traditional SEO stack looked like this:
	•	5–7 tools to manage
	•	Weeks of manual work
	•	Outputs = static reports and spreadsheets
	•	Actions delayed or lost in handoffs

⸻

Slide 9 (What’s Changed)

The fundamentals of SEO haven’t changed—still find, fix, and publish. But workflows can be redesigned:
	•	Collapse multiple tools into one workflow
	•	Replace static reports with live action lists
	•	Turn weeks of prep into actions teams can ship right away

⸻

Slide 10 (Our Approach with GA4L)

We built GA4L on a simple principle: less reporting, more doing.
	•	One backlog of ~100 actions per site
	•	50 traditional SEO, 50 AI-SEO
	•	Each action prioritized and ready to execute

This helps teams move faster, stay consistent, and focus on impact instead of prep.
